<video-slide title="Patches">
<p>Each time a source file is saved, the server
  recomputes the modified document and sends an
  XML patch to the browser.
</p>
<p>
This way, only the relevant part of the page is modified,
instead of reloading the whole document.
</p>
<p>This is useful for pages including MathJax, as only
the modified parts are to be typeset by MathJax.
