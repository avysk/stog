<p>This plugin overwrites predefined rewrite rules to
<span id="desc"> prevent OCaml code from being evaluated during
the compilation of documents</span>.
When this plugin is loaded,
<rule>ocaml-printf</rule> and <rule>ocaml-eval</rule> rules behave as
the <rule>ocaml</rule> rule, i.e. it only syntactically highlights
 the given code.

<p>Usage:</p>
<command-line>$ stog --package stog.nocaml ...</command-line>
