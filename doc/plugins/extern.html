<plugin title="Stog-extern">
<p>This plugin allows to use external commands to modify documents during their
computation.
</p>

<p>Usage:</p>
<command-line>$ stog --package stog.extern ... </command-line>

<p><em>Actions</em> are defined in the <code>.stog/config-extern</code>
configuration file. Each action
has a name and associates a list of document types and a command.
Here is an example of such a file:</p>
<hcode lang="json" defer_="1"><include file="../.stog/config-extern"/></hcode>
<p>
The dummy example above defines a new action <code>my-action</code>, with
a command <code>cat</code> that will be applied on documents of type
<code>post</code> or <code>page</code>. For each document matching the
type condition, the command will be given on stdin the current XML content
of the document and must output the result (valid XML) on stdout.
</p>
<p>
We also have to indicate when this action will take place. This is done
in the <code>.stog/config</code> file, in variable <code>levels</code>:
</p>
<hcode lang="json">
{
  ...
  levels: [
    { module: "extern", levels: [("my-action", [1000])] }
  ]
}
</hcode>
<p>Here, <code>my-action</code> will be applied at level 1000. The same
action can be applied in various levels. And of course, several actions can
be defined, with different commands and applied to different types of documents.
</p>
