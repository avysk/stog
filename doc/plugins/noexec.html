<p>This plugin overwrites predefined <rule>exec</rule> to
<span id="desc"> prevent shell commands from being executed during
the compilation of documents</span>.
When this plugin is loaded,
<rule>exec</rule> rule behaves as
the <rule>hcode</rule> rule, i.e. it only syntactically highlights
 the given command.
</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<command-line>$ stog --package stog.noexec ...</command-line>
