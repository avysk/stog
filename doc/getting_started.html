<section id="running" title="Running Stog">
<p>
To compile your web site, use the following command:
</p>
<command-line><![CDATA[stog <root-directory>]]></command-line>
<p>Stog will generate your web site in <icode>./stog-output</icode>,
except if you use the <icode>-d</icode> option to specify another
output directory.
</p>
<p>You can specify a template directory with the <icode>--tmpl</icode>
option. By default, the templates are searched in the <icode>.stog/templates</icode> directory
of the specified root directory.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to give more than one directory to <icode>stog</icode>. In this case,
all pages and articles are merged as if all were defined in the last directory
given. It may be useful to gather blogs or page to generate one big site. Or not.
</p>
<p>The <icode>--site-url</icode> option is used to override the <icode>stog:site-url</icode>
field of the main element. It it useful to generate a local site, for example
</p>
<command-line>stog --site-url file:///tmp/website your-directory</command-line>
<p>
to test your site locally with correct links.
</p>
<p id="optiondef">
The <icode>--def</icode> option can be used to define an additional global rule. For example
</p>
<command-line>stog --def stogdir:`pwd`</command-line>
<p>
will make the current working directory accessible using <icode>&lt;stogdir/&gt;</icode>.
</p>


<p>The <icode>--plugin</icode> option makes <icode>stog</icode> dynamically
load the given OCaml object file. The loaded plugin can define new functions
to associate to some tags, or even override some pre-defined functions.
See <page href="writing_plugins"/>.
</p>
<p>
If a plugin was installed with ocamlfind, the <icode>--package</icode> option can be used
to specify a list of comma-separated packages to load. <icode>ocamlfind</icode> will
then be used to get the location and required files to load these packages, in bytecode
for <icode>stog.byte</icode> or native-code for <icode>stog</icode>.
</p>
<p>At last, the <icode>--lang</icode> option is used to generate the website
for one language. By default, the only known languages are "en" and "fr".
If you use the <icode>--lang en</icode> option, then pages will be generated
in <icode>.en.html</icode> files and all <icode>&lt;fr&gt;</icode> nodes will be removed.
Then you can run <icode>stog</icode> with the <icode>--lang fr</icode>
to generate the "fr" part of your web site, removing all <icode>&lt;en&gt;</icode>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
If you need more languages, just define "stog:languages" in the main element
this way:
</p>
<hcode><![CDATA[<type main="true" ... stog:languages="es,de,fr,en">...</type>]]></hcode>
<p>This makes &lt;languages/&gt; returning the list of languages, and it is used by
the provided
-->
<p>
Stog will keep computed elements in directory <code>.stog/cache</code>.
To prevent stog from using this cache, use the <code>--nocache</code>
command line option. The cache won't be read, but it will nevertheless
be updated by contents of computed elements.
</p>
<p>
The caching strategy uses dependencies between elements: if an element
refers to another one (see <elt href="funs"/>), a dependency will be
added and stored in the cache directory, so that this dependency will
be used during the next run of stog. An element can also depend
on files: the templates used, the files included, ... Dependencies are
recursively computed.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, using recursive dependencies may be too complete. For example,
if you have a menubar appearing in all pages, all pages will depend on
the elements referenced by the menubar, leading to all elements depending
on all elements. A change in any element will then make every element recomputed
at each run. To prevent this, the <code>--depcut</code> option specifies
to use non-recursive dependencies in the caching strategy.
</p>
<p>
A convenient way to use stog is to create a Makefile with different targets,
to generate your site for a local test and for online publishing.
Have a look at <ext-a href="https://github.com/zoggy/stog/tree/master/doc/Makefile">this
Makefile</ext-a> used to build stog documentation.

<p>
The final files corresponding to elements are built the following way.
</p>
<p>Various rewrite levels are defined in Stog, and plugins can add more levels.
</p>
<p>A level is composed of a list of functions, each function taking an element
and returning the (eventually modified) element. Pre-defined levels are composed
of functions applying rewrite rules to element body.
</p>
<p>Various levels are required to ensure some rules will be applied after
others, for example to verify cross-element links. Each level has a number,
and levels are applied in order from 0 to n. Pre-defined levels are
numbered like lines in BASIC programs: 0, 50, 100, 120, ... making
plugins able to insert new levels.
</p>
<p>The first application of a level to an element uses the
type of the element to load the corresponding template; for example,
if the element has type "page", then a template <icode>page.tmpl</icode> will
be looked for.
</p>
<p>An environment is built containing the
<a href="stog-main-element">site-wide attributes</a> and the element attributes.
This environment is a set of rewrite rules.
</p>
<p>In each level, each function of the level is applied to the element current body
(the "first current body" is the template, where <icode>&lt;elt-body/&gt;</icode> will be
rewritten to the tree of the element body as given in the element file).
</p>
<p>The pre-defined levels contain pre-defined functions which apply
<page href="funs">default rules</page>, in addition to the rules from
the environment and rules added by plugins.
</p>
<p>When all levels were applied to elements, the contents of each element
is stored in the cache (the <icode>.stog/cache</icode> directory).
The final XML file is also created from this contents.
</p>
<p>Remark: If the element file was not modified since the corresponding
cache file was stored, nor its dependencies (see <elt href="#running"/>),
the contents of the element is read back from
the cache, and the level functions are not applied to this element.
</p>

<p>The environment is used in the following way.
For each encountered node with tag <icode>t</icode>, <icode>t</icode> is looked up
in the environment for its associated <em>function</em> <icode>f</icode>.
</p>
<p>If no <icode>f</icode> is found, then the XML node is left untouched
and the children of the node are then analysed.
</p>
<p>If <icode>f</icode> is found, then it is called, given the environment,
the attributes and the children of the node. Then the function returns
a list of XML trees which must then be analysed.
</p>
<p>When this analyze reaches a fixpoint, the final XML is returned.
</p>
<p>This work is performed by the <ext-a href="https://github.com/zoggy/xtmpl">Xtmpl</ext-a>
library.</p>
<p>Besides, the contents of the attributes are also analysed to perform such substitutions,
before looking up for the tag in the environment.
</p>
<p>Stog comes with <page href="funs">predefined functions</page>
associated to some tags, but more can be created in
<elt href="writing_plugins">plugins</elt>.
