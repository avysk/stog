Release 0.6[.1]:
  * mod: do not write the config file if it already exists
  * add: --depcut option, used when getting cached elements, to use
    only one level of dependency between elements; this is useful
    for example in case the site has a menubar, leading to having
    almost all elements depending on almost all elements.
  * add: <include> now handles a depend="false" attribute, to prevent
    adding a dependency of the element on the included file
  * mod: better cache system, using dependencies of each element on other
    elements and files; also handles the stog environment used to compute
    elements in cache, so that a change in the stog environment will
    make all elements recomputed (for example when language changes)
  * add: a rule using a file or another element must add a dependency from
    the computed element to the element or file it depends on, using
    Stog_deps.add_dep

    handling all elements at a time.
  * fix: add '.' after counters in section title
  * add: when a basic template is missing, create one and issue a warning;
    these templates are: page.tmpl, elt-in-list.tmpl, by-keyword.tmpl,
    by-topic.tmpl, keyword.tmpl, topic.tmpl, by-month.tmpl.

Release 0.4:
  * use separate tool to evaluate ocaml code; this allows to use native
    code version of stog even when evaluating ocaml code; also allow
    to use distinct ocaml toplevels in ocaml-eval (with session="...")
  * add simple cache system
  * new <inc> rule
