Server:
- detect needed server libraries at configuration time
- handle also single stog files instead of whole directories (like stog does)

Stog_info.compute should be a level fun in Base module

- function rules defined in docs:
     - use f_contents is rule is called f ?
     - or handle a param_="foo" to place contents in <foo/> instead of <contents/> ?

- import directive in document headers
- to fix: computation of doc graph

latex:
- cache <latex> evaluation
